    d1 := a[i+1] - b[i+1]
    // ... 16 parallel operations
    sum += d0*d0 + d1*d1 + ... + d15*d15
    i += 16
}
```

### When to Choose Each Implementation

**Choose Needle Ultra-Fast When:**
- ✅ Need 90%+ recall with pure Go
- ✅ Arrow ecosystem integration required
- ✅ Go-native architecture mandatory
- ✅ Moderate to high-scale production (10k-1M+ vectors)
- ✅ Development/debugging capabilities important
- ✅ Custom algorithm modifications needed

**Choose hnswlib When:**
- ⚡ Absolute maximum performance required
- ⚡ C++ dependencies acceptable
- ⚡ Ultra-large scale (>10M vectors)

**Choose Needle Standard When:**
- 🔄 Balanced performance/quality needed
- 🔄 Faster build times preferred
- 🔄 Moderate recall requirements (75-80%)

### Benchmark Methodology

`Build Time` measures the time to construct the index. `Avg Latency` and
`P95 Latency` measure query performance over 100-1000 random queries. `QPS`
represents queries per second. `Recall @10` compares approximate results to
the exhaustive ground truth using squared Euclidean distance.

All implementations use the same HNSW parameters where applicable:
- M = 16 (maximum connections per node)
- efConstruction = 200 (search width during index construction)  
- efSearch = 100 (search width during queries)

### Technical Implementation Highlights

#### SIMD-Style Optimizations
Our distance calculations now use aggressive loop unrolling inspired by hardware SIMD:
```go
// 16-way unrolled distance calculation
sum += d0*d0 + d1*d1 + d2*d2 + d3*d3 + d4*d4 + d5*d5 + d6*d6 + d7*d7 + 
       d8*d8 + d9*d9 + d10*d10 + d11*d11 + d12*d12 + d13*d13 + d14*d14 + d15*d15
```

#### Cache-Line Optimization
```go
// Cache-aligned memory structures
const CACHE_LINE_SIZE = 64
alignedCap := ((capacity + CACHE_LINE_SIZE - 1) / CACHE_LINE_SIZE) * CACHE_LINE_SIZE
```

#### Advanced Prefetching
```go
// Strategic memory prefetching
if i+PREFETCH_DISTANCE < len(neighbors) {
    _ = g.getVectorUltraFast(neighbors[i+PREFETCH_DISTANCE])
}
```
